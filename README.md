# hello-world
I probably won't even use this but if I do, it'll probably just be for junk and stuff like that. We'll see.

I'm kind of just doing this to go through the tutorial thing and learn how to use the site. I'm an AP Computer Science student and a senior in high school, and I intend to become a computer science major at the school I choose to go to. Don't ask which one because I haven't decided yet.
